# powerSupply
voltage and current regulated power supply

this is a clone of a schematic found in an old 1982 elektor magazine + fan cooling and overtemperature protection

It uses a ua723 voltage regulator chip for voltage reference and two ua741 for voltage and current limiting and regulation
Furthermore, it is designed to either screw TO-220 transistors on the pcb to a heatsink or clamp on a completely seperate "power-transistor pack"
There can be a NTC thermistor screwed into the heatsink, which is used for fan control and overtemperature protection, which is handled by a tl084
